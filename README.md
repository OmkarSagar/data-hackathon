# Data Hackathon

The following project is a result of my participation in __'Data Hack 2022: Data
Analytics BootCamp & Hackathon'__, a program put on by the Economics department of UCSB where students are taught to work with data in programming language R over the span of 12 weeks and then participate in a data hackathon. 

The hackathon entailed being sorted into groups and then (using data analytics) having the responsibility of convincing a panel of judges what Califronia policy should be prioritized by California policy makers. 

Judges consisted of leading faculty members on campus and city officers. 

Our group's policy of interest surrounded the ADU laws in Senate Bill 9 & 10 which are designed to develop new housing while saving existing low-income housing by easing the regulations and restirctions surrounding ADU (Accessory Dwelling Unit) construction in California. 

__Our objective was to show that the people who have the highest ability to capitilize on the regulatory changes will see an increase in wealth through both rent and appreciating property values. Furthermore we wanted to convey that this may drive a wedge in the ability for individuals to become homeowners.__

Data analysis tasks were accomplished in both R and Python and classifier construction for predicting housing prices was accomplished in Python.
